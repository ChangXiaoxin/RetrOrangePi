* Download site: http://www.retrorangepi.org/ (USA) or http://retrorangepi.xenlayer.com (FRANCE)

## Update from v3
ROPi 3.0.1 to 4.0 update will work by script, without the need of reflashing your sdcard all over again. Instructions: http://orangepi.club/showthread.php?tid=2216

## this RetrOrangePi repository features
- An EmulationStation RetroPie platform submenu
- Multiboot environment (runs from Armbian Desktop, available from ES soon)
- AV switcher with overscan fix (HDMI 720p, NTSC/PAL analog)
- eMMC installation tool (sdcard slot will still be alive after reboot)
- ROPi Wifi (a simple NMTUI run script, running from Desktop is recommended)
- ROPi Radio (retrogaming music streams from the web)
- Background music (add your own to ~/RetroPie/music)
- ROPi updater (new features, enhancements and tweaks weekly, translations to MANY languages in the works will come next.)
- Curvature shader + console overlays (for Libretro cores, press Select + X and use options from menu, overlay display and quick menu - shaders)

There are plenty of Retroarch customizations, like the unified retroarch.cfg, to make system-wide changes easier. You can still make custom changes in specific platforms/games by using the quick menu within game (Select + X) and the options Save Core/Game Overrides. Retroarch menu now works very smooth.

## Multiboot environment

ROPi 4.0 will firstly boot to EmulationStation; map your controller. You can open the Armbian Desktop and switch to your preferred boot-type (EmulationStation, AdvanceMENU, Retroarch, Kodi or Desktop)

### EmulationStation

The classic RetroPie frontend, features background music, custom ROPi theme and exclusive menu options (inside Retropie section).

### Retroarch

Libretro's own frontend/emulator, Retroarch is the heart of the emulation component. This option will get you a similar build of Lakka. (XMB menu driver) 

### Kodi

Boots to our Kodi Krypton 17.4 build, with hardware acceleration powered by MPV player and VDPAU. IPTVSimple is included; enable it from the addons menu.

### Desktop

Classic Armbian Desktop version, with several pre-installed applications. Includes onscreen keyboard, so you just need a mouse. 

### AdvanceMENU

MAME versatile frontend, supports picture and video snapshots. Reads roms from mame-advmame folder. Full integration with RetroPie platforms is possible and will be added soon (keyboard recommended).
